#Files and directories
#lets interact and create/modify simple files and directories

#import our libraries

import os
from pathlib import Path

# Define the file path use the r to show raw string
#python wants to use the backslash as an escape Character. there are two methods to get around either by double backslash or raw string

file_path = Path(r'c:\test\createdfile.txt')

# Check if the file exists
#Here is where I had issues with the file i had to start opening and creating with an encoder due to me getting other character sets in the file
if file_path.exists():
    print(f"{file_path} exists.")
else:
    print(f"{file_path} does not exist, creating file and directory if necessary.")
    # Ensure the directory exists
    os.makedirs(file_path.parent, exist_ok=True)
    # Create the file by opening it in append mode
    with open(file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        pass  # Just create the file, no need to write anything yet

# Append text to the file
with open(file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    file.write("Have a wonderful day! Python\n")

# Verify by reading from the file
print("Current contents of the file:")
with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    print(file.read())
