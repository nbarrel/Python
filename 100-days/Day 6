# Dealing with CSV's 
#This Exercise is from some work I had to do a while ago. I was frequently handed CSV files and had to parse them to exract the info
#A common example is when you are doing software maintaince and need to find out when the last time the software contacted the servers.
#today I learned how to accomplish the task with python, Of course AI has helped me along 


import csv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# variable
file_path = r"C:\test\parse.csv"  
# Use raw string (r"path")for Windows paths this prevents the backslash from being interpreted as a escape symbol
analyze_responses(file_path)


#function to take filepath it will open the file with read (mode='r') and sets my counter variables
def analyze_responses(file_path):
    with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        less_30_days = 0
        more_60_days = 0
        today = datetime.today()
#this loop only will return the outcome and not much more. If i wanted to save and log the data i would open/create file here
        for row in reader:
            last_response = datetime.strptime(row['Last Response'], '%Y-%m-%d')
            delta = today - last_response
#using the loop i would use the outcome to output the hostname,version,and date of last contact
            if delta <= timedelta(days=30):
                less_30_days += 1
            elif delta > timedelta(days=60):
                more_60_days += 1
        print(f"Hosts with last response within last 30 days: {less_30_days}")
        print(f"Hosts with last response more than 60 days ago: {more_60_days}")
