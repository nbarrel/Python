#Let's check disk space
#Checking disk space may be a task that is required. even though most enterprise systems have monitors this is useful
#When you have look at systems not attched to the monitoring solution.
#I wanted to showcase some other ways of approaching outputs. I wanted it to disply in the terminal and output to a file. unfortunatley i ran into encoding errors that I did not have time to troubleshoot (maybe a future excercise with psutils.
#in python there is no tee :(

import psutil
import time 

# Set the alert threshold
threshold = 90

# Check disk usage
for partition in psutil.disk_partitions():
    usage = psutil.disk_usage(partition.mountpoint)
    message = f"{partition.device} {usage.percent}%"
    print(message)  # Output to the terminal
    
    if usage.percent >= threshold:
        alert_message = f"Running out of space: {partition.device} at {usage.percent}%"
        print(alert_message)  # Output warning to the terminal
    
    time.sleep(3)  # Pause for 3 seconds before continuing to the next iteration
