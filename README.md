Python scripts for Gardening and System Administration

This repository is to showcase what I do with python my first introduction was back in 2020.

I started to create a indoor garden system that ran of a raspberry pi. eventually I found home assistant and started to focus there.

Recently I have started back on code academy and began learning python again.
